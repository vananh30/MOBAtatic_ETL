Project Summary
How to win a LOL(League of Legends) game, if you are not a mechanical player like Rookie, Uzi, or Faker? One way to make it, although less creatively, is copying what the winning others are doing.

This project explores 100,800 high ranked games in the KR(Korean) server, and trying to help to answer few questions that puzzled many players:

Who are the best buddies in champions?
What is the best build(items) of a champion?
Which is more important, dragon soul (getting 4 dragons) or Baron Nashor?
Does vision control really improve chances of winning?
In general, the final result will provide input for analysis of a LOL game in 3 dimensions: champion compositions, champion item builds, and team objetives/visions control

The project follows the follow steps:

Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data
Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data
Step 3: Define the Data Model
Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data
Step 5: Complete Project Write Up
